## Learning Python

1. Python was a hobby project
In December 1989, Python’s creator Guido Van Rossum was looking for a hobby project to keep him occupied in the week around Christmas. He had been thinking of writing a new scripting language that’d be a descendant of ABC and also appeal to Unix/C hackers. He chose to call it Python.

2. Why it was called Python
The language’s name isn’t about snakes, but about the popular British comedy troupe Monty Python (from the 1970s). Guido himself is a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Being in a rather irreverent mood, he named the project ‘Python’. Isn’t it an interesting Python fact?

3. The Zen of Python
Tim Peters, a major contributor to the Python community, wrote this poem to highlight the philosophies of Python. If you type in “import this” in your Python IDLE, you’ll find this poem:
