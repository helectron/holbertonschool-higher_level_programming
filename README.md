Some facts about this higher level and  multi-paradigm programming language:

1. Python was a hobby project
In December 1989, Python’s creator Guido Van Rossum was looking for a hobby project to keep him occupied in the week around Christmas. He had been thinking of writing a new scripting language that’d be a descendant of ABC and also appeal to Unix/C hackers. He chose to call it Python.

2. Why it was called Python
The language’s name isn’t about snakes, but about the popular British comedy troupe Monty Python (from the 1970s). Guido himself is a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Being in a rather irreverent mood, he named the project ‘Python’. Isn’t it an interesting Python fact?

3. The Zen of Python
Tim Peters, a major contributor to the Python community, wrote this poem to highlight the philosophies of Python. If you type in “import this” in your Python IDLE, you’ll find this poem:

## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! </span>
